# Advantages of Client Server Architechture
**The different advantages of client server computing are:**

All the required data is concentrated in a single place i.e. the server. So it is easy to protect the data and provide authorisation and authentication. The server need not be located physically close to the clients. Yet the data can be accessed efficiently. It is easy to replace, upgrade or relocate the nodes in the client server model because all the nodes are independent and request data only from the server.All the nodes i.e clients and server may not be build on similar platforms yet they can easily facilitate the transfer of data.

**Disadvantages of Client Server Computing**

The different disadvantages of client server computing are:
If all the clients simultaneously request data from the server, it may get overloaded. This may lead to congestion in the network.If the server fails for any reason, then none of the requests of the clients can be fulfilled. This leads of failure of the client server network.The cost of setting and maintaining a client server model are quite high.
