# Documentation on MERN STACK

* **MERN** is a set of javaScript technologies.
* MERN stands for **mongo db** ,**Express** ,**React** ,**node.js**.
* It provides end to end to end framework for developer to work in.
### A Closer Look at MERN Stack Components
1. **MongoDB :**  A cross-platform document database. It a NoSQL (non-relational)     document-oriented database. While conventional relational databases have a typical schema design based on columns and tables, MongoDB is schema-less. Data is stored in flexible documents with a JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)-based query language. The content, size, and number of fields in the documents can differ from one to the next. This means that the data structure to be changed over time. 

2. **Express :** A back-end web application framework. Express is a web application framework for Node.js, another MERN component. Instead of writing full web server code by hand on Node.js directly, developers use Express to simplify the task of writing server code. There’s no need to repeat the same code over and over, as you would with the Node.js HTTP module.The Express framework is designed for building robust web applications and APIs. It’s known for its fast speed and minimalist structure, with many features available as plugins.

3. **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.React was originally created by a software engineer at Facebook, and was later open-sourced. It is maintained by Facebook, as well as a community of development companies and individual developers.The React library can be used for creating views rendered in HTML. React views are declarative. This means that developers don’t have to worry about managing the effects of changes in the view’s state (the object that determines how components behave) or changes in the data.Instead of relying on templates to automate the creation of repetitive HTML or DOM (Document Object Model) elements, React uses a full-featured programming language (JavaScript) to construct repetitive or conditional DOM elements.With React, the same code can run on both the server and the browser.
React anchors the MERN stack. In a way, it’s the defining feature of the stack. It’s the one component that differentiates MERN from MEAN, another popular JavaScript stack that uses AngularJS (a front-end web application framework) instead of the React library.

4. **Node.js:** A cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment.Node.js was initially built for Google Chrome, and later open-sourced by Google in 2008. It is built on Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine. It’s designed to build scalable network applications, and can execute JavaScript code outside of a browser.Node.js works without an enclosing HTML page, instead using its own module system based on CommonJS, to put together multiple JavaScript files.
